No matter how popular your blog is, media law works for everybody.Everything written online relates to this act, so it is better not to slander somebody without real proof.	 
You are still free to leave a comment but make sure that it is not a mere assertion and there are no misplaced quotations.
Also don’t hurry placing unaccurate information for raising your popularity to prevent problems with the law.
And finally, you shouldn’t use ideas and materials from other sources without informing their rightowners.
